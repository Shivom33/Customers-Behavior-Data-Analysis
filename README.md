# Customers-Behavior-Data-Analysis
This project automates customer behavior analysis by performing ETL in Python, storing and querying data in SQL Server, and presenting insights via a Power BI dashboard. It offers a full-cycle solution from data extraction to visualization, empowering data-driven decisions.
1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

 2.Problem Statement

Businesses need to understand customer purchasing patterns to improve sales, marketing strategies, and customer retention.

This project aims to:

Analyze customer purchasing trends

Identify high-value customers

Understand product/category performance

Generate business insights using analytical queries

Build an interactive dashboard for decision-making

3. Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & ETL

Jupyter Notebook – Data preprocessing

Microsoft SQL Server – Data storage & analytical queries

Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation

4. Project Architecture

Raw Dataset
→ ETL in Python (Cleaning, Transformation)
→ Load into SQL Server
→ Perform Analytical Queries
→ Connect Power BI
→ Build Interactive Dashboard

5. ETL Process (Python – Jupyter Notebook)

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized column formats

Converted date fields

Performed feature engineering (if applicable)

Exported cleaned data to SQL Server

6. SQL Analysis

In SQL Server, the following analysis was performed:

Total Sales & Revenue Analysis

Customer-wise Revenue

Monthly/Yearly Sales Trends

Category-wise Sales Performance

Top Customers Identification

Aggregate functions & Window functions

Group By, Having, Joins, CTEs

This improved query optimization and real-world analytical skills.

7. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

KPI Cards (Total Sales, Total Customers, Revenue)

Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)

Category-wise Performance (Bar Chart)

Top Customers Analysis

Filters & Slicers for interactive analysis

The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify business trends and performance metrics.

8. Key Insights

Identified top revenue-generating customers

Discovered peak sales months

Determined best-performing product categories

Analyzed customer purchase frequency

9. Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Real-world ETL processing

Writing optimized SQL analytical queries

Data modeling concepts

Creating business dashboards

End-to-end data analytics workflow

10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete Data Analyst workflow — from raw data to business insights. It showcases technical skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI, along with analytical thinking and data storytelling capabilities.
